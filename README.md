# A Comparative Study of Effectiveness Between Classical Classification Machine Learning Algorithms and Neural Networks 
 
This is a repository to store information and code for my associate and I's senior research project. 

The objective of this project is to conduct a comparative study into how Classical Classification Machine Learning techniques and Neural Networks can accurately predict whether a machine will be the victim of an attack according to it's characteristics. Two classical classification algorithms, such as K-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines, and a Multilayer perceptron will be used to make these predictions. Such research will aid in the prevention of malware intrusion and the development of new anti-malware programs used to detect complex malware.
